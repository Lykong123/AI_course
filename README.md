Data

Below is the some website to get the dataset. 
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

 Python

 Most of the experiments are done in python. If you're not familiar with this language, there are numerous tutorials on the web. 
 A good one for instance is from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). If you want to be all set-up for experiments, here is a list of packages we will use. 
 Note that some of them are only available with pip, and not anaconda. If you're using anaconda, you can neverthless use them, using the pip command (pip install package_name). 

 - notebook. Jupiter notebook
 - pandas. Pandas
 - scikit-learn. Machine learning/Data mining
 - seaborn. plotting library

 A quick tutorial for pandas [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yquetzal/Teaching_notebooks/blob/main/Pandas_hands_on.ipynb#scrollTo=Sun0bs5-qPt3)

 A quick tutorial about python data structure (lists, dictionaries, sets,...) [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yquetzal/teaching_notebooks/blob/main/pythonDataStructureIntro.ipynb)
